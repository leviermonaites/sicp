### Answer v2
- While I was doing the 1.17 exercise, I noticed that there was indeed a need for the a variable
- The a variable's purpose is counting how much we should multiply at the end because of the iterations in which n was odd
- The reason for multiplication at the end is because as we are dealing with exponentiation which can be treated as repeated multiplications we are just multiplying the parts we skipped when n was odd.

### Answer v1
- I did it slightly differently from what was asked in the question
- I did not understand the reason for the existence of the a variable, so I did not include it
- My algorithm seems to be logarithmic and iterative.
